# Calculator

This is one of my first few projects, which is a simple calculator. I remember it was quite a challenge thinking of how to handle the data such that I would be able to chain operations both before and after pressing the equals button. This was a project which helped me develop my ability to think logically and computationally in order to solve a problem.

The project can be viewed in browser here: https://rawcdn.githack.com/jchy191/Calculator/b6be806657b17559d64b84f04a9edded52437377/Calculator.html

Looking back, I could have improved on the organisation of my code to make it more readable and less messy. I had not learnt about modules yet and as a result there are quite a few global variables which is bad practice. The naming of variables could have been done better as well.
